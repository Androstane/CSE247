Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Part A

What do you see in the plots for ticks and time?
n^2
How would you characterize those curves?
n^2
Based on the current code for addLast, why do you see this behavior?

Part B

What behavior do you see now for appending n items to a list if you use a tail reference?
Linear 
While we have reasoned so far only about time, if we are adding n elements to the end of a list, what is the asymptotic complexity of the additional space required when using the tail reference?
O(1)
Under what conditions would you recommend using a linked list with a tail reference vs. a linked list without at tail reference?
Always!
Part C

Why does getSize() take the time it does?
Linear because it goes through all elements in the list 
How did you achieve Î˜(1) performance for getSize()?
track size in add list method
